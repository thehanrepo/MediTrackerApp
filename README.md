# MediTrackerApp
MediTracker is a Java Swing desktop app for pharmacy inventory management. It lets users add, search, update, delete, and sell medicines with duplicate‑serial checks, stock level and expiry alerts, and automatic sales recording. Data can be loaded from files and viewed in a clean hospital‑themed GUI.
